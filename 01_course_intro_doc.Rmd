## Objectives 

- quick introduction
- motivation of the course
- syllabus fly-over



## Examples of contemporary data

### Taxicabs and the Shared Economy

- A team of mathematicians and engineers has calculated that if taxi riders were willing to share a cab, New York City could reduce the current fleet of 13,500 taxis up to 40 percent. [Link to news story](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/science/sharing-taxis-nyc-mathematics.html) and an [interactive site](http://www.hubcab.org/) with the data.
    - Traditional style: take a sample of taxi passengers.  Ask them where they got on and where they got off the taxi.
    - New style: 
        - Every taxi transaction is registered, including GPS coordinates of flag up and flag down
        - A taxi-hailing app can register all calls for service, even those that aren't successful.


### Gapminder

- Income & Life Expectancy:  
    - <https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2018;;&chart-type=bubbles>  
    - How many variables are being displayed here?
    - What are they?
    - What did you learn by watching the animation?
- Dollar Street 
    - <https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/matrix>
    - Are we even looking at "data" here?


### Medicare Spending

- Newspaper article [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/business/hospital-billing-varies-wildly-us-data-shows.html)
- Data available [here](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html).


## The logic of this course: Less volume, more creativity.

- A minimal set of simple tools can be combined in powerful ways
- Individually these tools are introduced as simple "data moves" 
- The complexity of data use and presentation comes from combining these simple tools in order to achieve our specific purposes.

## The logic of this course: Less volume, more creativity.

We will start with some infrastructure for these techniques:

- basics of "tidy" data
- commanding the computer to handle data and present the story we want to tell
    - focus on "exploratory data analysis"
    - we will combine graphs, numerical summaries, and narrative
    - we defer to future STAT courses for formal "modeling"

In coming weeks, we will study

- relationships between data and graphical presentations
- proper form of data to make a graphic (or a model) 
- how to "wrangle" data we have into the form needed for a graphic (or a model)
- use of layering to develop rich graphics 



## Examples from many fields

Some data sets we will access for examples.

<pre>
BabyNames                Names of children as recorded by the US Social
                            Security Administration.

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Due to the nature of the course and our goals, we will sometimes characterize our work from the paradigm of *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)*.  Some goals for high-quality EDA include:

- Become acquainted with the data 
- Explore intuition for research question 
- Discover features in the data that impact modeling decisions 



## Orientation to Class Resources

- R and RStudio 
    - **R** does the computations
    - **RStudio** is an interface to R that makes it easier to document your work, access nice features of R, and more

- git and GitHub
    - **git** is version control software used to facilitate collaboration and project evolution
    - **GitHub** is a remote git respository hosting service

- Access to R & RStudio
    - RStudio Server: [https://lat.tlt.psu.edu/home/remoteaccess/oss-web-apps/](https://lat.tlt.psu.edu/home/remoteaccess/oss-web-apps/)
        - Choose **Login to RStudio**
        - You only need an internet connection, a current web browser, & PSU login credentials
        - Pro: Penn State handles most of the configuration
        - Pro: Access all your R and RStudio stuff from any computer anywhere
        - Con: Takes some practice to get used to loading files on & off the server
    - Installing on your own computer.  You need both of these:
        - [R software](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
        - [RStudio desktop software](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
        - Packages: Paste the following R commands into your RStudio Console and run it (press Enter):

- Assignments, grades, etc will be handled with Canvas  
- Use Piazza for most questions about course content, e.g. "How do I rename a variable?"; see syllabus for detail
